# Restart here — current state

Where the work is now. Update this file at the end of a session; when a block stops
being current, move it to `docs/CLAUDE_HISTORY.md` (rules still in force go to
CLAUDE.md). What each version did: `CHANGELOG_ACFC.md`.

## State (2026-10-23, post103)

- **Branch** `feature/multi-table`, head post103 (`31b46ed`) + docs-only commits. Pushed,
  tree clean.
- **App** `codegen-agent` deployed at post103 from GitHub (2026-10-23 12:56 UTC).
  `/api/health` reports `0.5.8.post103`.
- **Current work:** scoring the agent's IIG workbooks against prod "golden" IIG rows —
  pair_2 (SD) first, for Venu. Deliverables: DDL / `metadata_inserts.sql` + the IIG
  workbook (runbook / playbook out of scope).
- **post98–103 verified on the App** on the pair_11 live run `demo_20261023_132913`
  (artefacts via `/api/combined/…` + a Playwright pass):
  - the combined set is `Pyx_Care_Management_Data_MI_DSNP_*` (no `STTM_`);
  - OBJECT_ID 1..5 across the run;
  - 12 pipeline rows = 1 grand master + 1 master (both Daily, `_DLY`) + 2 × 5 children;
  - the `_LOG.md` merged / kept lists; the short IDs line; IIG_REVIEW hidden;
  - Run summary + Feeds collapsed; View results hides the sidebar for the page only.
  - That run made NO model call: layout from the documents, `--layer2 defer`, 35 rules
    pending review.
  - PARENT_PIPELINE_ID is blank on the master + children (the framework assigns IDs),
    so the parent links show only in the review copy.
- **Live App results (post94–97):**
  - pair_03: PASS_WITH_OPEN_INPUTS with no answers.
  - pair_11: PASS_WITH_OPEN_INPUTS (answer the VDD question "none"); 67 combined rows,
    per-table reject paths.
  - pair_08: the live layout resolves the STTM; 7 blank stage types carry a proposal; then
    FAIL on the multi-table mismatch (the FRD names 4 stage tables in one cell).
  - pair_10: stops before generating on the delimiter of all 4 feeds and the load
    strategy / LOBs of feeds 1–3 (the BSA answered feed 0 only).
- **Decided by Soham (2026-10-22), not built:** the four Databricks workspace / cluster
  columns of DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_DETAILS stay blank and out of the panel; TEMPLATE_ID
  out of the IDs line.

## Next up — Nikshit's review (2026-10-23)

**DDL** (start here — Nikshit: refine the DDL metadata first; test cases separately):
- Column COMMENT = the STTM's field description ("Fill Description").
- A column the STTM / FRD marks as primary key: say so at column level.
- The load strategy (Truncate / Load / Upsert) appears in the DDL.
- Standard tables are managed: use table properties in the standard DDL.
- Keep the stage DDL (Nikshit thinks the framework doesn't need it; do not deprecate).
- **Check first:** `edo_sfmc` (`templates/framework/table_creation.txt.j2`) already emits
  per-column COMMENTs + TBLPROPERTIES. The `acfc_prx` combined DDL ACFC uses
  (`combined_ddl.txt.j2`) deliberately has none, and the pair-1 golden pins it byte for
  byte (`tests/test_m4_acceptance.py`). This needs a profile knob or a deliberate golden
  change — decide with Soham before editing.

**DDL test cases** (later): a generic best-practice set, chosen at runtime per feed,
filled with the feed's own values (target table, real location):
- positive / negative: file present; at the right location; column mapping correct;
  every column populated; column shift (negative: shuffle the columns);
- does the framework map by column name or by position?
- Soham may ask Jinesh / Suganya which file needs which cases.

**UX**
- Rename the blue button "Generate from this STTM…" to "Generate Documents"
  (`ui/frontend/src/pages/ModesPage.tsx`); rebuild + commit `dist`.
- On that click, a disclaimer with the approximate DBU / token cost of the run, computed
  from the actual documents (tokenizer over them → input / output tokens, priced against
  Opus 5.5), replacing the static estimate.

**IIG metadata**
- Connection IDs depend on the source; the ADLS connection ID comes from its associated
  table.
- Add RDMS_DELTA_INGESTION_DETAILS: MFT landing → ADLS, another SQL database → RDMS. The
  FRD's Functional Requirement cell says which; the agent reads it, states file vs table
  ingestion and recommends.
- New vs existing process, chosen when the FRD / STTM is selected:
  - new → names per the naming standard;
  - existing → the user gives the grand master pipeline name; the agent reads that
    pipeline's entries in the audit control DB + the FRD and adds only the new file
    ingestion. A new READ seam (the never-writes doctrine still holds).
- Child pipelines: Nikshit doubts every feed has its own children (pair_11: 12 rows per
  the standards doc vs 10 in the prod IIG). Find which groups run in parallel and which
  in sequence. **Hold this until after the session with Rama on Monday 2026-10-26.**
- Next level: how GROUP_ID / PIPELINE_ID and the other IDs get assigned (blank today by
  the never-invent-IDs rule).

## Open

**With Soham:**
- He reported the pair_11 combined DDL as "4 stage + 5 standard tables from 3 feeds";
  the App's pair_11 runs give 5 + 5, one pair per feed. Still to learn which file or run
  he counted (a pre-post97 download? the golden, which has 4 feeds?).
- The multi-table / contract-mismatch decision (blocks pairs 05 / 06 / 08 / 09, and
  pair_09's per-table load strategies from its STTM Summary sheet).
- Standards: the keep / drop table in `docs/acfc/STANDARDS_DEPRECATION_REVIEW.md` (alerts,
  timeout, default DQ on upsert, DBR 15.4 + Photon); then rewrite
  `docs/EDO_STANDARDS_ALIGNMENT.md`, `print` → logging in the v2 notebook templates, the
  `engineering_standards.status` line (byte-pinned outputs: one bump + snapshots).
- 106 `scripts/scrub_check.py` hits over tracked files on this branch (2026-10-23):
  mostly `docs/acfc/review/*.xlsx` and `IIG test cells.xlsx`, plus emails / ADLS hosts
  in a few tests and `app.yaml`. Keep or clean.
- This container's git uses the global `core.hooksPath=/app/python/source_code/.githooks`
  (its `post-commit` syncs to the Workspace), so the repo's `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`
  does NOT run here. Pointing the clone at `scripts/git-hooks` would drop the Workspace
  sync — decide how to run both.

**Codeable here:**
- `tools/iig_diff.py` depends on the `--agent` file order (30.0 sorted vs 30.3
  unsorted; run_round sorts). Sort internally.
- `test_demo_ui.py::test_choosing_an_sttm_auto_pairs_its_vdd` fails when a stale
  `ui/backend/state/document_index.json` exists (isolation gap).
- STGDELTA SRC_ADLS_PATH uses the standard table's name — wrong only when stage ≠
  standard names; no such pair found yet, so wait for one.
- RECYCL_ADLS_PATH on pair_11 (4 cells): the golden states a recycle no document does.
  Ask where prod got it.

**Needs others:**
- **The BSA:** pair_10's delimiters (4 feeds) and feeds 1–3 load strategy / LOBs;
  pair_08 `columns[87].target_type` is answered INT, probably STRING (INT in standard =
  STRING in stage, 39 of 39) — reported, not changed.
- **Nikshit / Venu:** child pipeline names — the EDO child pattern
  `PL_CHLD_<Product>_<Sub-Product>_<Source>_TO_<Target>_<Load Strategy>` has no feed slot,
  so every feed's children share a name (the `_LOG.md` lists them); the pair_11 golden
  uses an older pattern (`PL_File_PYX_CM_MIDS_<feed>_ADLS_To_Delta_Incr`). Tell Nikshit the
  document cannot give unique child names; do not deviate without his word. Also: which
  path convention is standard.
- **Nikshit:** re-confirm the D1 `storage_account` `z-use-d1-dlk-std-02` (given
  2026-10-21; hyphens are invalid in an Azure account name and it looks like a
  container; the earlier value is in `d1.yaml.bak_20261021_pre_storage_account`, volume
  only). If it changes: both state copies + the `storage_account` provenance text in
  acfc_env.yaml.
- **The ACFC framework team** — cells the pair-1 golden fills that no input determines:
  the semantics of `HEADER_FLAG` (`Y` in the golden for a fixed-width file whose first
  record is a header SEGMENT, while the FAQ's `has_header` means a column-header row);
  the stage leg's `TGT_LOAD_OPTION` / `TGT_REFRESH_TYPE` = `Overwrite` in the golden
  while the FRD's Load Strategy STG says `Append`; `LOB` blank in the golden while the
  FRD states `ALL`; the derivation of the STGDELTA row's `OBJECT_NAME`
  (`Accumulator_accumclient`) and `SOURCE` (the feed name, not the vendor). Until
  answered these cells follow the inputs and differ from the golden.
- **HEDIS owners (via Soham):** what prod deploys for one Stage → Consumption load + one
  deployed XREF and one claims example (`docs/acfc/HEDIS_CONSUMPTION_STTM_SHAPE.md` §6);
  nothing to build before that.
- **EMAIL_TO:** no value anywhere.
- **Raj:** the `USE CATALOG` grant (then app.yaml back to the volume; until then edit
  BOTH state copies: the volume and `/Workspace/Users/<me>/codegen/state/codegen-state`).
- **D1 / Genie:** the golden SRC_COLUMNS cells (rule 4 — re-apply with `git cherry-pick
  49d3e73 3b0082d` from local `wip/src-columns-rule4` if they confirm it), the
  PIPELINE_DESCRIPTION dump, the workspace-folder token.
- **Aruna:** `docs/acfc/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` §4–6.
- **Deferred by Soham:** pair_10's FRD prose values (file format / load strategy / LOBs in
  paragraphs, not in feed order) — a layout-model task.

## Driving the App and the container

- **Deploy:** the App builds from GitHub, not a staged tree. Push, then
  `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/cgs/oauth.cfg databricks apps deploy codegen-agent -p
  codegen-oaut --json '{"mode":"SNAPSHOT","git_source":{"branch":"feature/multi-table"}}'`
  (prints the resolved commit). Soham also deploys this way.
- **Token:** `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/cgs/oauth.cfg databricks auth token -p
  codegen-oaut` gives an OAuth token the App's API accepts (a PAT does not). URL
  `https://codegen-agent-4812116803419068.8.azure.databricksapps.com`.
- **Live runs:** the App runs live (`CODEGEN_PROVIDER=live` in app.yaml), so a run sends
  client documents to the model — Soham approves each pair (08 / 10 / 03 / 11 approved
  2026-10-22).
- **Flow:** `POST /api/demo/workbook {name}` (202, poll status `selection_job`) →
  `/api/demo/run-live {confirm: true}` → while paused, `/api/demo/layout-answers
  {answers, proceed | cancel}` or `/api/demo/rerun-with-answers {answers: {gaps},
  confirm: true}`. One run at a time: cancel a paused one first. The combined set:
  `GET /api/combined/<name>`.
- **Container harness:** pairs in `/Workspace/Users/<me>/frd_sttm_pairs/pair_<n>`; for the
  App's own state copy `environments/`, `overlays/`, `leakgate/` and `answers/pair_<n>`
  from `dbfs:/Volumes/d1_dlk/codegen/state/` into a /tmp state dir (`databricks fs cp
  -r`), then `PYTHONUTF8=1 .venv-d1/bin/python scripts/container_harness.py --pairs-dir
  <dir> --state-dir <dir> --out <dir> --work <dir> --pairs 3,8,9,10 --dry-run
  --output-mode framework`. `--pairs` is comma-separated. It is mock: pairs 08 / 10 stop
  at the layout step (no cached layout profile; the live App resolves it). Never run the
  CLI from the repo root with outputs in `out/`.
- **SharePoint:** memory `sharepoint-via-uc-connection` (read_files + `d1_dlk_sharepoint`
  on the Serverless Starter Warehouse). The 9 HEDIS workbooks are in
  `/Volumes/d1_dlk/codegen/state/hedis/stage_to_consumption/`.

## After a container reset

Venvs, `/tmp`, the OAuth profile and possibly `~/.gitconfig` are gone.

- **Venvs** via uv (pip's isolated pyspark build failed 2026-10-23):
  - `uv venv --python 3.12 .venv && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e
    ".[dev,ui,live,databricks]"`;
  - `.venv-d1` the same with `-e ".[dev,databricks]" -c constraints/acfc_d1.txt`.
- **OAuth:** the login's `localhost:8020` callback listens IN the container. Start
  `BROWSER=echo DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/cgs/oauth.cfg databricks auth login --host
  <the DEFAULT profile's host, `databricks auth profiles`> --profile codegen-oaut` in the
  background; Soham opens the printed URL and pastes back the `localhost:8020/?code=…`
  URL; `curl` that URL inside the container. A code only works for the login that
  issued it.
- **Git push:** `gh auth setup-git` (git then uses the `gh` login).
- **Browser checks:** Chromium in `/tmp/pw` + libs in `/tmp/pwlibs`, run with
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/pwlibs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/tmp/pwlibs/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
  PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/pw node <script>`. Stub `/api/feeds` or
  `/api/demo/status` with `page.route`. Rebuild:
  - `cd ui/frontend && npm ci`, then (no `npx` in the container)
    `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/pw node node_modules/playwright/cli.js install
    chromium-headless-shell`; a script `require`s that `node_modules/playwright` by path.
  - Libs: `apt-get download` + `dpkg -x … /tmp/pwlibs` of libglib2.0-0 libnspr4 libnss3
    libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libdbus-1-3 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3
    libxrandr2 libgbm1 libxkbcommon0 libasound2 libatspi2.0-0 libwayland-server0 libdrm2
    libxi6 libxrender1 libxext6 libx11-6 libxcb1 libxau6 libxdmcp6 libbsd0 libmd0
    libxcb-randr0; `ldd …/chrome-headless-shell | grep "not found"` must print nothing.
  - Against the deployed App: `newContext({extraHTTPHeaders: {Authorization: "Bearer
    <OAuth token>"}})`.
- **The MLflow Stop hook** in `/app/python/source_code/.claude/settings.json` was removed
  2026-10-23 (tracing was disabled and mlflow not installed; its `uv run` wrote
  `uv.lock` into the repo and rebuilt `.venv`). A reprovision may restore it — delete
  `hooks.Stop` again.
